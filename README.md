This is a simple account managemenet with a working signup and login.
when signed up, or logged in. THe server would return an auth toke. The client would constantly send verify requests to the server to verify if the token is valid and if to keep them logged in

this setup also uses a file type database using NeDB


I coudnt get to finish the settings section but some of it works
